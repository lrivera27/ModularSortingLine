# Modular Sorting Line Software

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

1. This projects uses Python 3.6, you can either download it from [their website](https://www.python.org/) or by downloading the [anaconda bundle](https://anaconda.org/) (recommended).

2. You need to install OpenCV, since this varies from Operating System to Operating System, we will not be including a guide on how to install it.

2. You will be needing pyserial for the communication between python and arduino.
	```
	pip install pyserial
	```
    
3. For the GUI, the software uses a small library called eel, which can be installed by running:

	```
    pip install eel
    ```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
